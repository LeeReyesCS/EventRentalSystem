Website has to be mobile friendly so make changes to fit it.


-> within rentals we should have pages to specify 
what kind of party and/or what kind of resource they could rent 
Here's an example of what I mean: https://www.primeluxevents.com/flower-walls
You can start researching what pages we should include


We also need to have a "cart" feature where people need to 
save what they like, but we can do that later after we populate the options
also we'll need to connect everything to email-js so you can watch a 
quick video on that and read the documentation
